Dvazquez5138,"March 24, 2024","Decades after her lackluster debut game on Nintendo DS, Princess Peach finally gets to headline a game worthy or her character. If you had the opportunity to download the demo on the Switch eShop you've got a pretty good idea of what you're getting with PPS. It's most definitely style over substance, but oh what style it is! It's one of the prettiest Nintendo Switch games I've seen, with lots of bright colors and beautiful, fluid animations. Stages offer a variety of things to see with prop-like environments, all themed in conjunction with the transformations she uses in said stages. The villain-of-the-week here, ""Grape"", isn't the most memorable but she's designed charmingly and I liked the fruit-centric name chosen for Peach's nemesis.Don't get me wrong about the gameplay. Though simplistic, that's not to say it isn't well done. PPS is just aimed at a younger audience as evidenced by the low bar of difficulty and ease of control. There are a few secrets and easter eggs strewn about for completionists. Nothing that will make you break a sweat, but I'm sure you'll be smiling nonetheless.Everything comes together in a package that's very Nintendo, which is to say that although Showtime isn't a high profile release, it IS a high quality release. The flourishes of studio Good-Feel are apparent all over, from general presentation to music. While on the subject I found the music tracks here to be of excellent quality. A few tracks felt like someone had mixed some Disney in with my Ninty. They're beautifully orchestrated for a fantasy adventure like Showtime, ranging from whimsical to punchy when the moods change.I would definitely recommend Princess Peach Showtime to younger audiences, Nintendo-enthusiasts, and above all Peach fans like myself. Despite a lack of true challenge, it was a fun time, and that's what we play games for!

Get even more by finding them hidden within plays and by completing challengesEquip the Heart Charm to give Peach a few extra heartsCollect all of the Sparkle Gems in each play to get an action photo of Peach in her transformationTest your mettle and see how long you can survive against waves of enemies in Action Rehearsal playsProduct DescriptionPrincess Peach must save the play as she takes the spotlight in her very own action game. Princess Peach and some loyal Toads are about to enjoy a performance at the Sparkle Theater when the wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch bust on the scene to flip the script! These bad actors kidnap the stars of each play, terrorize the other cast and crew, and leave Peach trapped inside as they steal the show.To curtain-call this tragedy, Peach must team up with the theater's guardian, Stella. Using the power of Sparkle, Peach must take the stage of each play inside the Sparkle Theater and transform to match the performance. Each transformation changes up the action and comes with its own abilities for Peach to use against Grape’s evil acting troupe. Only by clearing all the floors and rescuing the star actors can she truly save the theater!Play like a princess and transform into leading roles with showstopping abilities. Fend off the Sour Bunch as Swordfighter Peach as you slash and dodge attacks—en garde! Whisk up some tasty treats as Patissiere Peach and see just how quickly you can decorate a cake.Wrangle your foes with a lasso as Cowgirl Peach, hurl buses and slam foes with super strength as Mighty Peach, synchronize your spins with other performers as Figure Skater Peach, and more!

Serahe,"March 25, 2024","Really fun game to play with my 7yr old. Little hard for the kid but not too bad. It's extremely ""girly"" really leans into the outfit changes and pink, which I like. It's different. It's unique. It's a welcome change. Each level is so creative: ice skating, baking, sword fighting, cowboy, detective, ninja, spy... It's not repetitive. It's surprising. The bosses are really creepy and interesting. Length of the game is good. Levels are longer but not too long to get boring and have good replay value to try to get all the stars and bonus items. My only qualm is that it doesn't seem to fit into the Mario universe. Bad guys, good guys, & scenery don't connect to other Mario games.

Matt,"March 23, 2024","I was very excited for a Peach led game, but this is a disappointment.  Probably good for kids 10 and under, but this is not an adult or even young adult game.  It’s too easy and the graphics seem dated.  I feel like there was so much potential here that was overlooked.  If you’re 13+, I wouldn’t bother.
